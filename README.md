A way to eliminate 2nd Dozen and use less stake and still win
Demo wheel: https://www.roulettesimulator.net/simulators/french-roulette/

So place a 3 neigbour bet, cover 7 thru 0, then manually add same betsize on 29 and 32. This is only the one way to omit 2nd dozen at all. 
Look at my images how where to place the stakes. I use $1 unit on singles and $5 unit on middle dozen. 
You will actually earn $1 unit on 2nd dozen, but the main purpose is to omit 2nd dozen at all. 
So with 9 numbers you cover 24% of all numbers, but since we omit the 2nd dozens we up it to 35%. You are laddering using fibonacci. So - 1 loss, 1 loss, 2 loss, 3 loss - already here at 4th level you are expecting a win based on percentage. 5th level or 6th level, rare and 7th to 10th level must be considered extremely rare.
